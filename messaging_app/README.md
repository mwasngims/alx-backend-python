# Django RESTful API Project

## Overview

This project guides learners through the complete lifecycle of designing and implementing robust RESTful APIs using the Django framework. The goal is to create a clean, scalable, and maintainable API backend following Django‚Äôs best practices and modern development principles.

By building this project, developers will understand how to:
- Scaffold Django projects and apps
- Define relational database models using Django ORM
- Configure URL routing for RESTful APIs
- Establish model relationships
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code
- Optionally use Django REST Framework (DRF) for serialization and advanced API features

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Scaffold a Django project using best practices
- Define scalable data models using Django ORM
- Implement one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- Set up clean and modular URL routing using `path()` and `include()`
- Follow code organization, naming conventions, and documentation standards
- Build a maintainable API layer (optionally enhanced with DRF)
- Validate and test endpoints using Postman or Swagger UI

---

## üìö Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand Django project/app structure
- Design and implement relational database schemas
- Use Django Admin and Django Shell for data validation
- Build API endpoints that follow RESTful patterns
- Separate concerns by organizing views, models, and URLs cleanly
- Document endpoints clearly for collaboration and versioning
- Be comfortable using tools like Postman or Swagger for testing
